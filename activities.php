                  <li><strong>COBEC pre-conference workshop</strong>: RDA Training, Upcoming January/Febuary 2014</li>
                  <li><strong>Bylaws Discussion</strong>: A great deal of time was spent on reviewing the Bylaws and working on them to have them
                    reflect where we are today as an organization. Kirk Armstrong, (GCSU) agreed to take the
                  notes and have some of his grad assistants at GCSU put them into a proper format.</li>
                  <li><strong>Faculty Development Seminar Proposal</strong>: Dwight Call (GCSU, Ret.) and Neal McCrillis (Columbus State University) led a group discussion with a focus on having a Faculty Development Seminar which would involve both U.S. and Belizean faculty as well as both U.S. and Belizean students. Rationale for such a program was present and included in a proposal sheet distributed shortly after the conference.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Louisiana Students Travelling to Belize</strong>: <span>Dr. Rick Bateman, Jr. and his wife Araceli Bateman will be leading a Service Learning Trip to Belize. Thirteen students and a professor from Baton Rouge Community College (BRCC) will be in Belize from January 4-10, 2014. The group is partnering with Dr. Eve Aird and Sacred Heart College to organize the service learning experience which is being funded by the Student Government Association at BRCC and the Louisiana Community and Technical College System Foundation. </span><br /><br /><span>The BRCC students will partner with Sacred Heart Junior College students to identify a service
                    learning project that will be relevant to the needs of the community and they will complete the project together. Other activities planned include seminars on Belizean history, language, and culture to be led by Belizean experts. The visiting students will also take part in learning expeditions that will provide opportunities to understand the Maya heritage of Belize and issues of conservation.</span>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>COBEC Welcomes It’s First Emeritus Members</strong>: The conference at VSU was the first opportunity to recognize and welcome our new category of membership, our Emeritus members. Dr. Betty Flinchum, Dr. Tracy Harrington, Dr. Keith Miser and Dr. Dwight Cal (all present) represented our first class or emeritus members. Also in attendance were Dr. Jane Zahner (VSU, Ret.) and Dr. Jack Hasling (VSU, Ret.). It was great to see everyone again. We look forward to seeing you again in the future and hopefully, often. The years you all have given to COBEC and the experience and background you all have are valuable resources for our current membership. </li>
                  <li><strong>One of Our Own Recognized</strong>: Dr. Betty Flinchum was recently recognized by her alma mater as one of several “Women of
                    Distinction”. The University of North Carolina Greensboro recently notified Betty of her selection and she will be recognized and honored at a ceremony on October 24th in Greensboro. Congratulations Betty.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Valdosta State University to Take On COBEC Webpage</strong>: After some discussion regarding our website, who owns it, who is maintaining it and so on, Valdosta State University has agreed to host our webpage. Ms. Deborah Davis indicated that they have a separate server for their library and that she has graduate assistants who would be able to keep it current and looking good. COBEC owns the domain <a href="http://www.cobec.org">www.cobec.org</a> and we are now attempting to work with Oklahoma State University to see who can release the information on their site so it can be transferred over to the COBEC site. Hopefully we will have something up soon.</li>
                  <li><strong>Winter COBEC Conference</strong>: The winter 2014 COBEC conference is just around the corner. Stann Creek Ecumenical Junior
                  College in Dangriga will be serving as our Belize hosts. Both Chairs are already getting inquiries, which is great, as to when and where the conference will be. As usual, the College Fair will be in Belize City at our usual ITVET building on Wednesday, February 5th beginning at around 2:30 PM. This will be following the Library RDA workshops that will begin the last week of January. The conference itself will be held in Dangriga on Thursday, February 6th and Friday, February 7th. Dr. Karen Martinez will be providing us with more information regarding lodging and so on. In addition to the Pelican Beach Resort, we also have the Jungle Huts, Pal’s Guest House, and the Chaleanor Hotel in the Dangriga area. Lodging and a conference site in Hopkins is also being considered. And to our U.S. partners, if you have never been to Dangriga or Hopkins before, you are in for a treat. More to come on the winter 2014 conference.</li>
                  <li><strong>Preparing for Election</strong>: At our winter conference meeting we will be caucusing to select candidates for the
                  different offices within COBEC. All offices are up for re-election. This means we will be selecting candidates for the U.S. and Belizean Chairs, U.S. and Belizean Treasurer and the Belizean Treasurer also serves as the Secretary to COBEC. We might start keeping in mind who we would like to have serve in the various offices. The election of the new officers will take place at our summer conference at Indianapolis University in Indianapolis, IN. As I recall, we also discussed holding our summer meeting a little earlier in hopes of being able to catch everyone.</li>
