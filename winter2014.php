					<p>Stann Creek Ecumenical Junior College is thrilled to be hosting COBEC 2014. We are looking forward to see you all in February. We have a wonderful and very <a href="documents/Tentative agenda COBEC Winter 2014.pdf">educational agenda</a> prepared just for you. On-site registration will start from 8:15a.m. The opening ceremony should start at 9a.m.</p>
					
					<p>We have sent out a list with names of hotels in the area (Dangriga and Hopkins). The conference will be held at Pelican Beach Resort, starting at 9a.m., on February 6, 2014. Kindly let us know where you will be staying as soon as possible - this will help with our internal planning.</p>
					
					<p>A reception will be held in the evening of the 6th at Ecumenical College Auditorium (Dangriga). We are still waiting to confirm a few things before we send out the official agenda (we hope to do so before the end of this week).</p>
